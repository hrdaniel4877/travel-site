1. right click on the project's folder and "Git Bash Here"
2. run "gulp watch" to preview the source code; browsersync will create and run a server and will open a browser to preview your site
3. run "gulp build" to rebuild the live compressed version; this will be placed in the "dist" folder
4. run "gulp previewDist" to preview in browser the distributable version; if any change has been made to the source code, "gulp build" has to be ran first to have updated and synced versions.
